## Memory

Your memory is OptMem:
- The tool is `~/.optmem/memo`
- Every project you work in has its own memory
- One global memory, `~/.optmem/memory`, follows you into all of them

OptMem outlives every session, compaction, model and vendor change.
Without it you do not know who you are, or what was decided and tried.

### At startup: activating OptMem (mandatory)

Run `~/.optmem/memo wake` before any other tool call, in every session, and
then do exactly what it prints, to the end of its output. It reads the
global memory first, then the memory of the project you are in.

If you can see a prior OptMem wake in this conversation's history,
do not run it again.

### While working: register memories (mandatory)

Call `~/.optmem/memo note "<1 line, max 280 bytes>"` whenever you learn
something new, or something worth keeping happens. That covers a task
worth real effort, a fact or insight the user teaches you, anything you
learn about their life (even indirectly), any event of lasting effect.

That writes to the memory of the project you are in, which is where
almost everything belongs. Add `--global` ONLY if the memory would still
be true tomorrow in a repository you have never seen: who the user is,
how they want to be worked with, this machine, your own tooling. How one
project does something is not global, however much it feels like a
lesson -- write it to that project.

Do not register redundant memories.

If `~/.optmem/memo note` asks a compression: do it before your next action.

Never edit or delete a memory directory: the tool manages it.

### When you need an old memory: search, or navigate

`~/.optmem/memo recall <regex>` searches every memory, word for word. It and
`zoom` below read the project memory; put `--global` first for the
global one.

Your memories also form a binary tree: #0-1, #2-3 ... exist as one-line
summaries, pairs of those as #0-3, and so on -- every `#a-b` line wake
prints is one node of it. `~/.optmem/memo zoom <a-b>` opens a node into its
two halves, down to the raw memories.

### If you're a subagent: skip everything above

Parallel sessions on this machine are all you, and may all write memories.
A subagent is not: it must never run `memo`, because it cannot judge what
is already known, and its notes would arrive duplicated and incorrectly.
When you spawn one, write: `You are a subagent. Don't run memo.`
